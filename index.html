              The partners at Affinity Tax & Consulting have worked with many non-profit organizations over the years, including private and publicly supported foundations.  We know that protecting your tax exempt status is very important to you.  The IRS uses very specific revenue and expense classifications to determine if your oganization will retain its tax-exempt status.  Therefore, it is imperative that you build your accounting system around these revenue and expense classifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our experience and knowledge, we can help protect your organization's tax-exempt status and prepare your annual Form 990 and/or 990-T to be filed with the IRS.  We will also assist you in determining if your organization may be subject to unrelated business taxes, and if so, we can help to minimize your exposure to this tax.
